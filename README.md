# AquaBounce Landing Page

AquaBounce Landing Page is an interactive and visually captivating landing page developed using jQuery, CSS animations, and clever HTML structures. Designed to mimic the fun and dynamics of a swimming pool, this project showcases smooth animations and engaging user interactions.

## Key Features

- **Bouncing Balls**: Balls appear on the page with smooth animations, jumping into position like swimmers diving in. They settle into a circle formation, reminiscent of synchronized swimmers.
- **Ripple Effects**: Each ball landing creates a ripple effect using the jQuery ripples plugin, adding a realistic water touch.
- **Clickable Magic**: Clicking on any ball breaks the formation, sending balls floating to new positions and revealing hidden content cards with additional information.
- **Close Button**: A close button allows users to regroup the balls into their perfect circle formation instantly.
